            <h1>About Food Safety Recall</h1>
            <p>This site was developed in response to GSA’s RFQ for Agile Delivery Services (ADS I).  It was developed as a working prototype using open toolsets and the openFDA (https://open.fda.gov) dataset and Application Programming Interface.</p>
            <p>Following the Agile methodology, IBA’s team designed, developed and implemented this end-user focused, Food Safety Recall lookup website for use in checking Food Recalls against the FDA data, while at the store or in preparing a grocery shopping list.  The site is responsive and focused for the specific location and items a shopper would be concerned about and useable from their smartphone or laptop.</p>
            <p>Using a continuous process improvement development method allowed IBA to implement, test and deploy versions within containers for test, stage, and production while end-user feedback was incorporated throughout the process to ensure a user focused solution.</p>
            <p>Technologies represented in this site include:  Ubuntu, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Node.JS, Angular.JS, JQuery, Express, Bower, Mocha, Jenkins-CI and Docker.</p>
            <p>This project was delivered to the GSA via the GitHub repository for evaluation and selection purposes.  It will be further enhanced as IBA receives feedback.</p>
